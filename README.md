# Gallery 

## Introduction

This is an Ruby on Rails application demonstrating how Knockout JS can be integrated with Rails 3.1.

I've uploaded it to [heroku](http://gallery-sz.heroku.com).

## How To Use

You can add up to 10 different image url and text(brief label) to the index list. You can also edit existing image urls at your choice.
When clicking the 'View' link, it will show the image on your browser, and switch to the next image after 5 seconds.

## TODO

Data storing on server.
